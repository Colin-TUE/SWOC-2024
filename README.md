# A Python bot for the SWoC 2024 challenge

This bot specifically is created as a berserker or kamikaze snake. The goals is to disrupt the strategies of the other players, especially if they only go for food and do not split their snake.

Basic strategy is to have one snake, aka the mother ship, to scavenge for food and each time food is found immediately dispatch a berserker to find and kill a snake from another player.

## Running the client

From the `PythonClient` folder run the following command `python HelloWorld.py` or run `python HelloWorld.py > run.log` if you want to capture the logs in a file.

## Server Code

The server code can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/matthijsman/Swoc2024).
